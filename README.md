# Visual-Cryptography-Scheme-for-secret-image-retrieval
Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures,
text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that decryption becomes the job of the person to
decrypt via sight reading.
At the present scenario where the technology reached the advanced sky, everything is done
over internet. With the ease of sending data, specifically pictures over the server, there is the
chances of unauthorized party access. In order to protect the picture and send to the intended
person visual cryptography comes in role.
Visual cryptography is one of the most secure techniques the allows the user to encrypt the
secret images by transforming them into printable transparent sheets and these sheets can be
distributed to different intended person through various mediums (physically, internet).
On receiving the intended person may regenerate the original image by stacking all
transparent sheets on each other.
Visual cryptography used in different application around the corner of the world , few examplebiometric
security,watermarking, steganography,remote electronic voting, Bank customer
identification, etc.
Our project presents a visual cryptography scheme that can generate n number of transparent
shares with reduced size and supports a specific image formats and presents an integrated
approach for binary, Gray and color image visual cryptography by maintaining the visual
quality and pixel expansion.
