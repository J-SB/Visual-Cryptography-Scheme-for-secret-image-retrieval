# Visual-Cryptography-Scheme-for-secret-image-retrieval
Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures,
text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that decryption becomes the job of the person to
decrypt via sight reading.

At the present scenario where technology is so vast, everything is done
over internet. Nowadays, sending data specially pictures over the network(internet) is highly prone to unauthorized access. In order to protect data(image) and send it to the intended user visual cryptography comes in role.

Visual Cryptography is one of the most secure techniques that allows the user to encrypt the
secret image by transforming them into printable transparent sheets and these sheets can be
distributed to different intended person through various mediums (physically, internet).
On receiving the intended person may regenerate the original image by stacking all or few
transparent sheets on top of each other.
Visual Cryptography is used in various applications.For example:- Biometric security, Watermarking, Steganography, Remote Electronic Voting, Bank Customer
Identification, etc.

Our project presents a Visual Cryptography scheme that can generate n number of transparent
shares with reduced size and supports a specific image formats and presents an integrated
approach for binary, Gray and color image visual cryptography by maintaining the visual
quality and pixel expansion.
